            Welcome to the wide world of piracy!

            <p>Here are a variety of sources and information pertaining to internet piracy, while keeping this as legal as
                possible.This is an will be an overview of the history of internet piracy, starting from the inception of the world wide web, until now.
                
                I will also include links to find more information about piracy, for those curious, and I will include guides on installing legal pieces of software, 
                such as and better alternatives to already existing apps.</p>
                
            <h3>A Short History</h3>
           <div class="paragraph">
             <p>The first recorded instance of piracy, in the context of distributing copywritten works without permission,
                was done by a fourteen-year-old Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart after entering the Sistine Chapel, 
                he heard Gregorio Allegri’s Miserere being performed. The sheet music was only authorized to be viewed by three people: Leopold I, John V of Portugal, 
                and Giovanni Battista Martini. After hearing it, Mozart went back to his hotel and transcribed the entire piece from memory, 
                coming back to proofread the transcription as it was being performed. After he published the piece, the fame he gained 
                from this act had grown such so that Pope Clement XIV summoned him back to Rome to be granted papal knighthood.

            </div>
                 <p>Starting in 1980s with the availability of the dial-up modem, 
                    this led to the creation of warez distribution groups.
                    Warez refers to pirated software (copied, not stolen from the source) 
                    that is distributed across the Internet.
                </p> 
            <div class="paragraph">
            <p>The release of Napster in 1999 caused a rapid upsurge of online piracy of music, films and 
             television although music was the main focus in the MP3 format. Napster was a peer-to-peer
            (P2P) file sharing application which allowed users to send files directly through each other, 
             donating some power from your system for the file transfer to work.</p>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="img/napster.png" alt="Napster's interface" 
                    style="width:250px;height:200px;">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Although Napster eventually shut down in 2001, lasting only 2 years, it was too late. 
            Other iterations such as Kazaa and Limewire 
            popped up and filled in the gap that Napster left.</p>
                
             <p>Although it was short-lived, Napster's reign allowed its users 
                to dive into the grey area of content piracy. Following its shutdown, 
                many other popular P2P file sharing programs arose: the creation 
                and usage of Limewire quickly followed suit. Learning from the mistakes 
                of Napster, Limewire decentralized their servers by implementing the
                Gnutella network. The success of the BitTorrent communication protocol 
                led to the rise of many other popular programs that are still widely 
                used today including μTorrent, Transmission, Deluge, qBittorrent, 
                and Tixati. Digital piracy as a continuing problem significantly 
                impacts various stakeholders, including consumers, enterprises, 
                and countries. This global problem can impact media- and content-oriented
                industries.</p>
               
                <h3>The Scene</h3>
                <p>
                    The warez scene or "The Scene" refers to the underground, international, organized network of
                    pirate groups specializing in obtaining and illegally distributing digital media for free.
                    The Scene includes all form of digital media, including movies, TV shows, video games, software, 
                    music, and pornography. 
                    <p>The Scene is meant to be underground and hidden from view, only being shared
                    to those within the community. However as the popularity of piracy grew, torrent files and other
                    files became more visible to the public to download and share. The core of the Scene is coolness, 
                    credibility (or cred), acquiring social capital instead of wealth. The more well-known and credible 
                    you were in the Scene, the more respect and "original" you have become.</p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The term "warez" and its leetspeak form W4r3z, are words to describe content that has been
                    illegally copied and distributed online. Hence, wares. Warez are made open to distribution after
                    it has been "cracked", meaning its copy-protection has been circumvented. Once the "cracker" cracks
                    the software for it to be used, warez distribution groups distribute the software through torrent files.
                </p>
                <div class="paragraph">
                <p>The warez scene started emerging in the 1970s, used by predecessors of software cracking 
                    and reverse engineering groups. Their work was made available on privately run bulletin 
                    board systems (BBSes). At the time, setting up a machine capable of distributing data was not trivial, 
                    and required a certain amount of technical skill; this was usually taken on as a 
                    technical challenge. The BBSes typically hosted several megabytes of material, 
                    with the best boards having multiple phone lines, and up to one hundred megabytes 
                    of storage space, a considerable expense at the time. Releases were mostly games and 
                    later software. 
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="img/bbes.png" alt="an example of a BBE" style="width:350px;height:250px">
                    </div>
                </div>
                   <p>As software and hardware became more complex to prevent distribution, and the tools 
                    to distribute became more readily available, warez groups, or "The Scene" (the term used to 
                    describe the network of warez groups as a collective) had to change their strategies. Instead
                    of simply distributing, there was a focus on cracking copyright restrictions and non-commercial reverse engineering.
                    As more and more people joined the Scene, requirements for promotion within these groups 
                    emerged, which prompted the rise of the artscene. </p> 
                    <div class="paragraph">
                    <p>The artscene refers to the creation of graphical art
                    created through the use of characters and symbols posted on BBSes. These artworks are created using ANSI and ASCII
                    to create text-based art, and many artists within this scene would design the .nfo (info) file of the crack. These 
                    .nfo files would act as the press release for the group, and would act as the certificate of authenticity
                    explicitly explaining what group released the software and described what modifications (or cracks) were
                    applied, if any. Once a group had packaged a crack with an .nfo, it was officially owned by that 
                    group and no other group could ethically rerelease that package.</p> 
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="img/nfo.png" alt="an .nfo file">
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Also within the Scene emerged another subculture known as the DemoScene. The DemoScene is completely legal,
                    as this scene is a collection of artists, muscicians, and computer programmers build short but 
                    increasingly complex, procedural animations called "demos" to showcase their technological mastery.
