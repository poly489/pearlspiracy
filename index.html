    <p>Welcome to the wide world of piracy!</p>

    <p>Here are a variety of sources and information pertaining to internet piracy,
    while keeping this as legal as possible. This is an will be an overview of the history of internet piracy, 
    starting from the inception of the world wide web, until now.
                
    I will also include links to find more information about piracy, for those curious, and I will include guides on installing legal pieces of software, 
    such as and better alternatives to already existing apps.</p>
                
    <h2 id="home">A Short History</h2>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>The first recorded instance of piracy, in the context of distributing copywritten works without permission,
                was done by a fourteen-year-old Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart after entering the Sistine Chapel, 
                he heard Gregorio Allegri’s Miserere being performed. The sheet music was only authorized to be viewed by three people: Leopold I, John V of Portugal, 
                and Giovanni Battista Martini. After hearing it, Mozart went back to his hotel and transcribed the entire piece from memory, 
                coming back to proofread the transcription as it was being performed. After he published the piece, the fame he gained 
                from this act had grown such so that Pope Clement XIV summoned him back to Rome to be granted papal knighthood.

                style="width:140px;height:180px;">
                </div>
            </div>
                 <p>Starting in 1980s with the availability of the dial-up modem, 
                    this led to the creation of warez distribution groups.
                    Warez refers to pirated software (copied, not stolen from the source) 
                    that is distributed across the Internet.
                </p> 
            <div class="paragraph">
            <p>The release of Napster in 1999 caused a rapid upsurge of online piracy of music, films and 
             television although music was the main focus in the MP3 format. Napster was a peer-to-peer
            (P2P) file sharing application which allowed users to send files directly through each other, 
             donating some power from your system for the file transfer to work.</p>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="img/napster.png" alt="Napster's interface" draggable="true"
                    style="width:250px;height:200px;">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Although Napster eventually shut down in 2001, lasting only 2 years, 
                it was too late. 
            Other iterations such as Kazaa and Limewire 
            popped up and filled in the gap that Napster left.</p>
                
             <p>Although it was short-lived, Napster's reign allowed its users 
                to dive into the grey area of content piracy. Following its shutdown, 
                many other popular P2P file sharing programs arose: the creation 
                and usage of Limewire quickly followed suit. Learning from the mistakes 
                of Napster, Limewire decentralized their servers by implementing the
                Gnutella network. The success of the BitTorrent communication protocol 
                led to the rise of many other popular programs that are still widely 
                used today including μTorrent, Transmission, Deluge, qBittorrent, 
                and Tixati. Digital piracy as a continuing problem significantly 
                impacts various stakeholders, including consumers, enterprises, 
                and countries. This global problem can impact media- and content-oriented
                industries.</p>
               
            <h3>The Scene</h3>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>
                    The warez scene or "The Scene" refers to the underground, international, organized network of
                    pirate groups specializing in obtaining and illegally distributing digital media for free.
                    The Scene includes all form of digital media, including movies, TV shows, video games, software, 
                    music, and pornography. </p>
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="img/warez hierarchy.png" style="width:170px;">
                    </div>
                </div> 
                    <p>The Scene is meant to be underground and hidden from view, only being shared
                    to those within the community. However as the popularity of piracy grew, torrent files and other
                    files became more visible to the public to download and share. The core of the Scene is coolness, 
                    credibility (or cred), acquiring social capital instead of wealth. The more well-known and credible 
                    you were in the Scene, the more respect and "original" you have become.</p>
               <p>
                    The term "warez" and its leetspeak form W4r3z, are words to describe content that has been
                    illegally copied and distributed online. Hence, wares. Warez are made open to distribution after
                    it has been "cracked", meaning its copy-protection has been circumvented. Once the "cracker" cracks
                    the software for it to be used, warez distribution groups distribute the software through torrent files.
                </p>
               
                <div class="paragraph">
                <p>The warez scene started emerging in the 1970s, used by predecessors of software cracking 
                    and reverse engineering groups. Their work was made available on privately run bulletin 
                    board systems (BBSes). At the time, setting up a machine capable of distributing data was not trivial, 
                    and required a certain amount of technical skill; this was usually taken on as a 
                    technical challenge. The BBSes typically hosted several megabytes of material, 
                    with the best boards having multiple phone lines, and up to one hundred megabytes 
                    of storage space, a considerable expense at the time. Releases were mostly games and 
                    later software. 
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="img/bbes.png" alt="an example of a BBE" 
                        style="width:300px;">
                    </div>
                </div>
                   <p>As software and hardware became more complex to prevent distribution, and the tools 
                    to distribute became more readily available, warez groups, or "The Scene" (the term used to 
                    describe the network of warez groups as a collective) had to change their strategies. Instead
                    of simply distributing, there was a focus on cracking copyright restrictions and non-commercial reverse engineering.
                    As more and more people joined the Scene, requirements for promotion within these groups 
                    emerged, which prompted the rise of the artscene. </p> 
                    <div class="paragraph">
                    <p>The artscene refers to the creation of graphical art
                    created through the use of characters and symbols posted on BBSes. These artworks are created using ANSI and ASCII
                    to create text-based art, and many artists within this scene would design the .nfo (info) file of the crack. These 
                    .nfo files would act as the press release for the group, and would act as the certificate of authenticity
                    explicitly explaining what group released the software and described what modifications (or cracks) were
                    applied, if any. Once a group had packaged a crack with an .nfo, it was officially owned by that 
                    group and no other group could ethically rerelease that package.</p> 
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="img/nfo.png" alt="an .nfo file">
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Also within the Scene emerged another subculture known as the DemoScene. The DemoScene is completely legal,
                    as this scene is a collection of artists, muscicians, and computer programmers build short but 
                    increasingly complex, procedural animations called "demos" to showcase their technological mastery.

                <p>
                    Ah, VPNs, the amazing service that they provide. First of all, what is a VPN?
                </p>
                    <p>
                    A VPN, or virtual private network, is an online service that provides a mobile app, 
                    desktop app, browser extension or other software that encrypts your internet traffic 
                    to help boost your privacy online. A VPN also prevents your internet service provider 
                    from tracking which websites or apps you're using and stops most of those websites and 
                    apps from seeing your actual geographic location, allowing you to bypass content blocks
                     in some countries to access critical news and educational information, while also 
                     opening up your streaming entertainment options. The best VPN delivers a strong level 
                     of privacy protection without compromising on performance. We strongly recommend using 
                     a good VPN for everyday use as well as for work, particularly if your work involves
                      handling sensitive information.

                    <div class="paragraph">
                    <p>
                    Mullvad is the VPN that I personally use. Mullvad is an independent and open-source VPN provider 
                    that is focused on building trust through transparency and its commitment to protecting the
                     privacy and security of its users. Although there are other VPNs that are considerably more 
                     well-known in the industry, Mullvad's offering overall is just as polished and easy to use 
                     as many of the bigger players in the market.</p>
                     <div class="image-container">

                <p>The company says it doesn't keep any logs of its users' activity, and is, for the most part, 
                    pretty transparent about how it operates and what it does to protect user privacy. Mullvad 
                    is unique in that it doesn't require any personal information at signup. While most VPN 
                    providers ask users to provide an email address and enter a username, Mullvad generates 
                    a random 16-digit account number to activate each new user account. You don't even need 
                    to provide any payment information since Mullvad accepts cash sent via mail.</p>
                
                
                    <p>Mullvad's source code being entirely open source is a testament to the company's transparency.
                    Although Mullvad tells us a new security audit is forthcoming, the company's 2020 security audit 
                    (conducted by German cybersecurity firm Cure53) 
                    concluded at the time that the VPN "does a great job protecting the end user from common 
                    PII leaks and privacy-related risks."</p>
                
                    <p>Mullvad VPN is 5 dollars a month, with no other deals for a yearly plan. Just 5 dollars a month.</p>

                <p>
                    Proton VPN is a great and free VPN for users who want to try out a VPN. 
                    This includes just three VPN server locations (Japan, Netherlands, and the US) 
                    and only allows one device to be connected at a time. You do have to create an 
                    account with Proton VPN to access its free tier, but you also get access to the 
                    rest of the Proton product line (Drive, Calendar, Mail), including the new Proton 
                    Pass password manager. Neither Mullvad VPN nor IVPN requires you to create an

                    <p>
                        This section is about torrents, what are torrents, and what 
                        they can do for you!</p>
                
                        <p>Torrents, in short, are computer files that contain metadata about files 
                            and folders to be distributed. Torrents, when used with a bittorrent client, 
                            can download small parts of the original file that other people have downloaded. 
                        These are called peers, and these peers allow for the downloading of a file in place of a 
                        primary server. 
                        When torrenting, the number to keep track of is the number of "seeders". Seeders are the users who have 
                        already downloaded the file, and are letting other users download the file from them. The more seeders,
                        the faster the file downloads.</p>
                
                        <p>
                            When downloading "illegal" content, such as movies, TV shows and video games, 
                            the primary method to download these files is through torrenting. Which is why it is 
                            illegal.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Anyway, here is the Bittorrent client that, in my opinion, is the most transparent, and reliable for use!

                            come with the spy and malware that many other torrenting clients have. The interface is easy to 
                            use, and there are many plugins that you can install to customize your experience.

                        <h3>Why don't you recommend more torrents?</h3>
                        <p>
                            The answer is that many torrent clients are riddled with malware and spybots that can do harm
                            to your computer. I personally am a bit scared of testing software that is known to cause damage, 
                            so I can only recommend one client. However, if you are still curious, feel free to look online!
                            There are many resources on the web on sites such as reddit, online piracy forums, and reviews to search
                            through.

                    What is the purpose of this site?
                </p>
                <p>I made this site as a project for my graphic design class, as I am passionate about the 
                    online piracy scene and I feel that the art of messing around with your computer has become lost.
                    This site can hopefully be a gateway into learning more about the legacy of piracy, as well
                    as fostering a sense of understanding with your machine. However, take caution! Common sense and 
                    logic is your friend here for avoiding installing viruses. Get a trusty VPN and the world is your
                    oyster.

                <p>What started this interest?</p>
                <p>My introduction to internet piracy came from my brother. When I was young, ~6-7 years old, 
                    he would show me the movies and games he "acquired" and I found it to be really cool! 
                    Unfortunately he did get caught, and an a letter from our ISP arrived as he had installed 
                    "The Big Short". That was the last straw apparently. My first foray into piracy came from 
                    when I was twelve years old. I had a Macbook Air, and I really wanted to play Assassin's Creed.
                    So I went on Pirate Bay, found a torrent for it compatible to the Mac, and booted it up. It 
                    loaded fine, the only issue was the keyboard could not read inputs. After this, the floodgates 
                    were open and here I am now trying to get everything for free*.
